Option 2: Use pgAdmin if it's installed
If you have pgAdmin installed (it often comes with PostgreSQL on Windows), you can:
Open pgAdmin
Connect to your database
Right-click on your database and select "Query Tool"
Run the following SQL:

-- First, find the schema
SELECT table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'clients' LIMIT 1;

-- Then use that schema name (replace 'user' if different)
SELECT setval('user.clients_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM user.clients), true);
