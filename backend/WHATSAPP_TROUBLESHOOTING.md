# WhatsApp Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Connection Timeouts (10/10 attempts error)

If you're seeing the "WhatsApp client initialization timed out" error after 10/10 attempts, try these solutions:

#### Solution A: Use the Fix WhatsApp Script

We've created a specialized tool to fix WhatsApp connection issues:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run the fix script
node fix-whatsapp.js
```

This script will:
- Check for common issues with your WhatsApp connection
- Allow you to reset all session data
- Provide a simplified way to authenticate with a new QR code
- Diagnose and fix dependencies or configuration issues

#### Solution B: Manual Reset

If the script doesn't work, try these manual steps:

1. Stop the server completely
2. Delete the WhatsApp session data:
   ```
   rm -rf whatsapp-data/*
   ```
3. Restart the server and scan a fresh QR code

### 2. QR Code Never Appears

If the QR code doesn't appear:

1. Check that your server has necessary permissions
2. Verify that Puppeteer and its dependencies are installed:
   ```
   npm install puppeteer --save
   ```
3. Try using the non-headless mode by modifying `backend/config/whatsapp.js`:
   ```js
   // Change this line
   headless: false, // Set to false to see the browser
   ```

### 3. Authentication Failures

If you see "Authentication failed" errors:

1. Delete all session data using the fix script
2. Ensure your phone has a stable internet connection
3. Make sure WhatsApp on your phone is up to date
4. Try scanning with a different device if possible

### 4. Browser/Puppeteer Crashes

If you see browser-related errors:

1. Install all required dependencies:
   ```
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install -y gconf-service libgbm-dev libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget
   
   # For CentOS
   sudo yum install pango.x86_64 libXcomposite.x86_64 libXcursor.x86_64 libXdamage.x86_64 libXext.x86_64 libXi.x86_64 libXtst.x86_64 cups-libs.x86_64 libXScrnSaver.x86_64 libXrandr.x86_64 GConf2.x86_64 alsa-lib.x86_64 atk.x86_64 gtk3.x86_64 ipa-gothic-fonts xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-utils xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 xorg-x11-fonts-misc
   
   # For Windows
   # No additional dependencies needed for most cases
   ```

2. Try reinstalling Puppeteer:
   ```
   npm uninstall puppeteer
   npm install puppeteer --save
   ```

### 5. Rate Limiting Issues

If you're experiencing rate limiting or message sending failures:

1. Add delays between messages (2-3 seconds minimum)
2. Limit the number of messages sent in quick succession
3. Ensure you're not sending identical messages repeatedly
4. Consider using the "Force Reconnect" button in the UI

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Checking Logs

Check the application logs for detailed error messages:

```bash
# Check the last 100 lines of logs
tail -n 100 logs/app.log

# Search for WhatsApp-related errors
grep -i "whatsapp" logs/app.log | grep -i "error"
```

### Checking WhatsApp Web Status

Sometimes WhatsApp Web itself may have issues. Check if you can access [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) directly from your server (if it has a browser).

### Environment Variables

You can configure some aspects of the WhatsApp client through environment variables:

```bash
# Disable WhatsApp service completely
DISABLE_WHATSAPP_SERVICE=true

# Set custom path for Chrome executable
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/chrome
```

## Need More Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check that your WhatsApp account on your phone is active and working
2. Make sure you have a stable internet connection on both server and phone
3. Try the connection from a different network
4. Contact our support team with the error logs and details about your environment
